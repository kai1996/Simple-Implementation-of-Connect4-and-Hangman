# Simple-Implementation-of-Connect4-and-Hangman
I wrote these two games in Python when I was beginning to learn how to code. 

I never thought I would pursue a major in Computer Science. I started loving how CS taught 
me to think structurally about a problem and break it down into feasible steps. 
Then, I could find the larger solution by making sure each small step is logically sound.
That realization and fascination to CS has kept me going these years and I am on track to graduate 
college with a CS degree.
